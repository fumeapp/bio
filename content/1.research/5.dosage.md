## When to Increase Dosage

For all peptides (Tirzepatide, Retatrutide, and Cagrilintide), consider increasing the dosage if/when you feel the current dose is not as effective as it once was. Signs that may indicate a need for dose increase include:

1. Plateauing weight loss
2. Increased appetite or reduced feelings of fullness
3. Diminished effects on blood sugar control (for patients with diabetes)

Always consult with your healthcare provider before making any changes to your dosage. They will evaluate your individual response, tolerability, and overall health status to determine if a dose increase is appropriate and safe for you.

Remember that dose increases should be gradual and follow the recommended titration schedule for each medication. Your healthcare provider will guide you through this process to minimize side effects and optimize the benefits of your treatment.
